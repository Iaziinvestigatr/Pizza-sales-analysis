### Project Structure

- **Data Extraction & Analysis**:
    - MySQL was used to extract and calculate important sales metrics, including total revenue, order trends, pizza category performance, and more.
    - The extracted data was analyzed based on 12 key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide business stakeholders with comprehensive insights into pizza sales.
- **KPI Analysis & Visualization**:
    - KPIs were selected based on their relevance to business success, such as total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, customer behavior, and sales by category and size.
    - An advanced Excel dashboard was created using interactive elements like PivotTables, Charts, and Slicers to make it easy for users to visualize daily/hourly trends and compare different KPIs.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Total Revenue**: Measures the total sales revenue generated.
2. **Average Order Value**: Calculates the average value of an order.
3. **Total Pizzas Sold**: Tracks the total number of pizzas sold.
4. **Total Orders**: The total number of unique orders placed.
5. **Average Pizzas Per Order**: Tracks the average number of pizzas sold per order.
6. **Daily Sales Trend**: Analyzes sales trends on a daily basis to identify peak days.
7. **Hourly Sales Trend**: Evaluates hourly sales patterns to determine the most profitable hours.
8. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: Breaks down sales by pizza category (e.g., Veg, Non-Veg).
9. **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**: Analyzes the sales distribution by pizza size (small, medium, large).
10. **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**: Tracks the total pizzas sold per category.
11. **Top 5 Best Sellers**: Identifies the top 5 pizzas with the highest sales.
12. **Bottom 5 Best Sellers**: Lists the 5 pizzas with the lowest sales.

### Excel Dashboard

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
    - The project uses MS Excel to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize the data extracted via MySQL queries.
    - The dashboard contains various charts, graphs, and pivot tables that display trends such as:
        - **Total Revenue** over different time periods (daily, hourly).
        - **Sales by Pizza Category** and **Pizza Size**.
        - **Top 5 Best Sellers** and **Bottom 5 Best Sellers**.
    - Slicers and filters make it possible to drill down into specific days, hours, or pizza categories to get more granular insights.

### Key Features

1. **SQL-Based Data Extraction**:
    - Efficient data extraction using SQL to retrieve key metrics from the sales dataset, ensuring precise KPI calculations.
2. **12 KPI Analysis**:
    - A comprehensive analysis of 12 key performance indicators to understand sales performance and customer behavior.
3. **Excel Dashboard**:
    - The Excel dashboard provides interactive visualizations like line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps to represent the analyzed data.
    - The dashboard includes slicers and filters for drilling down into specific metrics and time periods for more focused analysis.
4. **Sales Trend Analysis**:
    - Daily and hourly sales trends offer insights into peak business hours, helping optimize resource allocation.
